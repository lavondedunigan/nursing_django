# Understanding the MVT Pattern in Django

The MVT (Model-View-Template) pattern is Django’s take on the traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern. It helps separate concerns in your web application, making it easier to manage and scale.

## What is MVT?

Component   Responsibility
Model   Manages the data and business logic of the application (database layer)
View    Contains the logic that retrieves data from the model and passes it to the template
Template    Defines how the data is presented to the user (UI layer)

### MCV
Model View Controller is common for most frameworks.

Unlike MVC, Django handles the controller part itself — the framework acts as the controller.

## Analogy

Think of building a blog:

    •   The Model defines what a Post is (title, content, author, etc.)
    •   The View fetches all blog posts and sends them to the UI
    •   The Template loops over the blog posts and renders them as HTML

Components Explained

1. Model (Data Layer)
    •   Defined in models.py
    •   Interacts with the database

3. Template (Presentation Layer)
    •   Stored in the templates directory
    •   Uses Django Template Language (DTL)

## Flow

    •   User Request ➝ URL Dispatcher ➝ View ➝ Model ➝ View ➝ Template ➝ Response

    •   Easier debugging and testing
    •   Clean project structure
    •   Scalable and maintainable
